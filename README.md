# ****CODEX****
## **Introduction**
**CODEX**  is a platform for all enthusiastic tech minds. Being a Coding Club, we do almost anything and everything related to Coding. Codex is a common platform for all the
technology geeks who share the same passion for Coding. We'll master the fundamental
concepts of programming in this club.

We (referring to core members) from **Codex** ensure to provide the following to our peers (Members):
+ Development of problem-solving skills
+ Computational thinking
+ Persistence
+ Collaboration
+ A deeper understanding of a range of mathematical concepts and language.  


# About
This Repository is to establish guidelines, to enhance the appropriateness of practice. We state functions of the Competitive Programming domain, Defining the straightforward procedure to the core- the team that how it should perform and defining to participants how it will complete.  
  
  Core Team members should use the Repository for proper practice for the CP - Projects.
# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING (CP)

## 1. Definition: 

 *Competitive Programming*  teaches you how to think. If you are a programmer, you might have understood the deep meaning of these lines quoted by Steve Jobs, and you might have also experienced that even after shutting down your computer, you keep thinking about programming stuff or code you have written in your project. Once you enter programming, you don't learn how to code, but you also know the **"art of thinking"** by breaking your code into smaller chunks and then using your logic-based creativity to solve a problem from different angles. Competitive Programming is fun. Competitive Programming is an exercise for your brain. Competitive Programming is a mental sport, and when this sport is held on the internet involving sports programmers as a contestant, then it is called Competitive Programming.

## 2. CP in CODEX:

**The competitive Programming Domain** in **Codex** functions to conduct Competitive programming tests like contests and hackathons. They also function to increase the knowledge of understanding programming languages, frameworks, and architecture that enables a coder to create any digital product. Through the domain, the club ensures the growth in participants' talent via training them in:
   * Identifying and defining the problem.
   * Come up with possible solutions.
   * Evaluate the options.
   * Choose the best solution.
   * Implement the solution.
   * Evaluate the outcome.

   #### Basically, the domain works on a motto
   > *In learning, you will teach, and in teaching, you will learn*


## 3. Functions of CP_DOMAIN in Codex:

There are two functions of **CODEX** to ensure **Competitive Programming**. They are:
- Coding Contest
    * Coding Against Time (CAT)
    * Coding Contest
- Hackathons

## 3.1. Coding Contest:
**Coding Contest** is a competition held frequently (at least once a month). These are again two types:
* Coding Contest
* Coding Against Hackathon
