# COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING (CP)

## 1. Definition: 

 *Competitive Programming*  teaches you how to think. If you are a programmer, you might have understood the deep meaning of these lines quoted by Steve Jobs, and you might have also experienced that even after shutting down your computer, you keep thinking about programming stuff or code you have written in your project. Once you enter programming, you don't learn how to code, but you also know the "art of thinking" by breaking your code into smaller chunks and then using your logic-based creativity to solve a problem from different angles. Competitive Programming is fun. Competitive Programming is an exercise for your brain. Competitive Programming is a mental sport, and when this sport is held on the internet involving sports programmers as a contestant, then it is called Competitive Programming.

## 2. CP in CODEX:

**The competitive Programming Domain** in **Codex** functions to conduct Competitive programming tests like contests and hackathons. They also function to increase the knowledge of understanding programming languages, frameworks, and architecture that enables a coder to create any digital product. Through the domain, the club ensures the growth in participants' talent via training them in:
   * Identifying and defining the problem.
   * Come up with possible solutions.
   * Evaluate the options.
   * Choose the best solution.
   * Implement the solution.
   * Evaluate the outcome.

   #### Basically the domain works on a motto
   > *In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn*


## 3. Functions of CP_DOMAIN in Codex:

There are two functions of **CODEX** to ensure **Competitive Programming**. They are:
- Coding Contest
    * Coding Against Time (CAT)
    * Coding Contest
- Hackathons

## 3.1. Coding Contest:
**Coding Contest** is competition held frequently (atleast once in a month). These are again two types:
* Coding Contest
* Coding Against Hackathon
